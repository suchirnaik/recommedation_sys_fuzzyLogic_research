# Recommendation System with Fuzzy Logic

## Overview
This project aims to develop a hybrid recommendation framework that combines fuzzy logic with content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The primary objective is to enhance traditional recommendation engines by applying fuzzy rules derived from data analysis. These fuzzy rules augment the capabilities of both content-based and collaborative filtering methods, improving the quality of recommendations.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main parts:

### Datasets
This directory contains the datasets used in the recommendation system. Proper data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are carried out to create the fuzzy logic rules. 

### Python Books
This section encompasses the Python codebase and logic for building the recommendation system. The primary steps involved are:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned and structured to be used for generating fuzzy logic rules.(Pre_processing_for_fuzzy_logic)

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Analyzing the data to identify patterns and correlations, which will inform the creation of fuzzy logic rules.(EDA_KPMG_2)

3. **Fuzzy Logic Integration:** Implementing fuzzy logic to create rules based on the insights from EDA. These fuzzy rules will enhance the recommendation process. Membership functions creation (membership_functions_ver2)

4. **Combining Fuzzy Logic with Apriori and Clustering:** Integrating fuzzy logic with other techniques like Apriori and clustering to further enhance recommendation accuracy.(mem_5_apriori)

5. **Upcoming: Collaborative Logic:** A collaborative filtering approach will be added to the project to complement the existing techniques
